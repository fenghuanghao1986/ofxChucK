# example_OculusDK2

This example uses the [OculusDK2 addon from mattebb][ofxOculusDK2]. The addon only works on [OF version 0.8.4][OFver084] and OSX at the moment. As usual, clone this whole repository into your `OpenFrameworks0.8.4/addons/ofxChuck` directory, and then make sure you also have the ofxOculusDK2 addon. Finally, make sure you've downloaded and installed the [Oculus Runtime for OS X V0.5.0.1-beta][oculus-dl].

If all goes according to plan, you should be able to open this xcode project and build.... Fingers crossed...
